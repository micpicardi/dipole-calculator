The applets contained in this folder have been designed to allow the user to tailor the angular spectrum of electric and magnetic dipolar sources in order to achieve the desired excitation of up-to-six guided modes. The user is prompted to input the normalised wavevectors characterizing each guided mode in the xy plane and the complex amplitude to be achieved for each mode. The software returns the complex values for the electric and magnetic dipole moments which realise the designed excitation.

This folder contains two applets. The one named dipole_calculator_mathematica_free.cdf has been designed to be used with the free Wolfram Player which can be downloaded at this link: 

https://www.wolfram.com/player/

Users who don’t have a Mathematica license can download both the player and the applet for free. Due to the restrictions in the free player, this applet can only accept numerical values for the wavevectors and the field’s amplitudes. 

The applet named dipole_calculator_mathematica_full.cdf is intended to be used with Mathematica. Users who already have a Mathematica license can avoid downloading the free player and run the applet like a standard Mathematica notebook (enabling the dynamic processes). In this version, the user can input numerical AND symbolical values for the wavevectors and the field’s amplitudes.
